## 🐛 V0.9.1 - Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements - ✅ COMPLETED

**Date**: December 31, 2025
**Context**: Post-launch fixes following public announcement (449 unique sessions on Reddit)

### Critical Bug Fixes

**Symlinks**:
- [x] Fixed: Creating child from symlink now adds child to **target** instead of symlink itself
- [x] Fixed: Symlink title display - shows **symlink's own title** (not target's) in center panel
- [x] Added: Visual indicator in metadata showing link to original node (clickable)

**Data Persistence**:
- [x] Fixed: `Esc` (go to parent) now **saves current node** before navigation
- [x] Fixed: `Alt+E` (toggle view mode) now **saves before switching** (displays changes immediately)
- [x] Fixed: All navigation (tree clicks, arrows, breadcrumb) now **auto-saves** before switching nodes

**UI/i18n**:
- [x] Fixed: Empty content in children list showed `[labels.emptyContent]` → now displays translated text
- [x] Fixed: Action modal tree in branch mode showed **global tree** → now shows **branch tree only**

### New Features

**Orphan Nodes Cleanup**:
- [x] New function: `cleanOrphanNodes()` in `data.js`
- [x] Detects nodes not referenced anywhere (not in rootNodes, not in children, not in symlink targets)
- [x] UI button in right panel storage section
- [x] Confirmation + toast feedback
- [x] Full FR/EN translations

**Cross-Tab Synchronization**:
- [x] Implemented `storage` event listener

- [x] Smart reload: preserves current node if exists, goes to root if deleted
- [x] Toast notifications: "Data reloaded" / "Data reloaded - node deleted"
- [x] Perfect for workflow: branch in new tab → auto-sync to main tab

**Mobile Warning Banner**:
- [x] Mobile device detection (Android, iOS, iPad, etc.)
- [x] Non-intrusive orange banner at top
- [x] Professional message about work-in-progress mobile experience
- [x] Dismissible (×) with localStorage persistence (shows once)

### Bug Fixes

**i18n Issues**:
- [x] Fixed: `result.replace is not a function` error in `generateMarkdownHelpContent()`

### IndexedDB with Dexie.js
- [x] Migration from localStorage to IndexedDB (automatic, non-destructive)
- [x] Three object stores: `nodes`, `settings`, `attachments`
- [x] 500 MB - 1 GB storage capacity (vs ~5-10 MB with localStorage)

- [x] Migration flag: `deepmemo_migrated_to_indexeddb` in localStorage

### .dm Archive Format
- [x] Official `.dm` file extension (ZIP archive with custom extension)
- [x] `metadata.json`: Version, type (global/branch), title, date, stats, generator info

  - Single root → imports as branch
  - Multiple roots → creates container node with export title
- [x] JSON Schema validation: Against `docs/schemas/deepmemo-v1.0.json`
- [x] Graceful degradation: Missing files tolerated, warnings displayed

### PDF Export
- [x] CloudFlare Worker: Online generation with Browser Rendering API
  - Rate limiting: 5 PDFs/hour, 20/day per IP

  - Supports .dm archives (ZIP extraction)
  - No rate limiting
- [x] Symlink resolution: Content included, descendants excluded if external to scope
- [x] Inline images: Attachments converted to base64 data URLs
- [x] Cycle detection: Prevents infinite loops

- [x] Updated "Collaboration & Sharing": Focus on current export/import .dm workflow
- [x] Added PDF section: Documented online and offline PDF export options
- [x] Simplified "Explored Directions": Vague mention of future sync without promises
- [x] Tone adjustment: "We're exploring, we'll see" - no teasing of unimplemented features
- [x] Template literal fixes: Escaped backticks in markdown content (`.dm` → `\`.dm\``)

### Documentation
- [x] FILE-FORMATS.md v2.0: Complete .dm format specification
- [x] FORMATS-FICHIERS.md v2.0: French version synchronized
- [x] file-formats/ZIP-FORMAT.md: Quick reference for .dm structure
